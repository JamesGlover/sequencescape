<%= alert(:user_guide) do %>
  <p>The preferred method of registering samples is sample manifests.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sample manifests support both plates and tubes</li>
    <li>Sample manifests let you register pre-tagged libraries</li>
    <li>Sample manifests have no limit on the number of tubes which can be registered in one go</li>
    <li>Sample manifests provide additional support, such as drop down lists to assist you
    in filling out the spreadsheet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If there is functionality you need that is not provided by sample manifests
  then please let us know.</p>
  <%= link_to 'View and generate manifests', sample_manifests_study_path(@study) %>
<% end %>

<p>If sample manifests aren't suitable, sample registration is still available and offers two options:</p>

<h2><%= link_to "1. Manual entry", new_study_sample_registration_path %></h2>
<p>Type your samples in online using the manual entry form.</p>

<h2><%= link_to "2. Spreadsheet load", upload_study_sample_registration_index_path %></h2>
<p>Pre-populate the manual entry form with values from an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
